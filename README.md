Game Jolt Ribbons!
==========

Put 'em on your pages. Inspired by [GitHub's glorious Ribbons](https://github.com/blog/273-github-ribbons). Open sourced so you can make modifications as needed.

The idea was to make a Ribbon that was more in line with the Game Jolt style. Using the Game Jolt color palette, and Open Sans (which is the default heading font we use), they look pretty snazzy. They should work on light and dark backgrounds.

Feel free to make modifications to them to fit your projects page.
